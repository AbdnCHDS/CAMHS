# **CAMHS**

Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) is the name for a range of NHS services which aim to help young people who experience serious emotional, behavioural or mental health difficulties.

The services are delivered by a range of healthcare professionals including psychiatric nurses, child and adolescent psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists (including child/analytical, systemic/family, cognitive behavioural), creative therapists (including art, music and drama), play therapists, liaison teachers, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and dietitians.

This website presents plots which illustrate trends in CAMHS referrals, waiting lists and numbers of open cases. These are mostly shown comparing 2020 and pre-pandemic trends. It shows figures for Scotland, by Health Board with an additional highlight on NHS Grampian.
